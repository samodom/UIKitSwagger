Switch Toggling Convenience
===========================

Although modifying the `on` property of `UISwitch` (with or without animation) is simple enough, sometimes it's nice to see more explicit actions in code.  Thus, the following are provided:

 - `var off: Bool`
 - `func setOff(off: Bool, animated: Bool)`
 - `func turnOn()`
 - `func animateOn()`
 - `func turnOff()`
 - `func animateOff()`
 - `func toggle()`
 - `func animateToggle()`
