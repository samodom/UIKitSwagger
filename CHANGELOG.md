UIKitSwagger Changelog
======================


### Pre-Release Version 8 ()
 - Added layout methods for filling a view's superview
 - Added layout edge and direction types
 - Added activation methods to constraint arrays
 - Added character attribute type to simplify creation and modification of attributed strings
 - Added `SwaggerView: UIView` with IB-designable properties


### Pre-Release Version 7

##### v0.7.0 (Friday, September 11, 2015)
 - Updated for Swift 2.
 - Updated for iOS 9 -- still supporting back to iOS 8 except for new iOS 9 features.
 - Improved documentation for better Quick Help support.
 - Layout constraint equivalence now accounts for priority.
 - Constraint searches no longer return optional arrays of constraints.  Missing constraints will now yield an empty array.
 - The `Constraint` typealias has been removed.
 - Making a positive constant constraint from one that is already non-negative will return the original constraint.
 - Removed `NSLayoutConstraint.apply()`, `NSLayoutConstraint.remove()`, `ApplyConstraints()` and `RemoveConstraints`.  Use the activation/deactivation functions instead.
 - Layout constraints are no longer addable/removable to/from views using the `+=` and `-=` syntax.  Use constraint activation/deactivation instead.
 - Constraint-producing functions that added their constraints to the appropriate view now use activation to accomplish that task.
 - Removed `firstCommonAncestor` from UIView since constraint activation obviates the need for knowing where to apply a constraint.
 - Fixed a newly discovered constraint search bug.
 - Removed `UIColor` from all color component type names
 - **iOS 9 and later:**
  - Layout guides are now supported in the constraint builder syntax. (iOS 9 and later)
  - Layout guides are now addable/removable to/from views using the `+=` and `-=` syntax.  They are added and removed along with views to make sure that modifier items make sense.
  - Added simpler stack view creation functions

 - Added CMYK component structure at feature parity with all other component types
 - Removed `UIColor` component-based initializer
 - Added functions to easily turn off autoresizing-mask-to-constraint translation
 - Added methods and functions for constraining view dimensions to a constant or interval
 - Renamed equal-dimension constraint functions to 'Match' functions
