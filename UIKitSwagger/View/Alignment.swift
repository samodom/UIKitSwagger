     Convenience method for creating, activating and returning constraints that will fill this view's superview.
     - Parameters:
       - inDirections: Set of layout directions in which to fill.  Only one horizontal idiom is allowed and the leading-to-trailing and top-to-bottom directions are used by default.
       - excludedEdges: Set of layout directions to exclude from filling.  Any edges provided must match the directions being used.
       - inMargins: Flag indicating whether or not filling should be performed with respect to the superview's layout margins.  By default, margins are not used.
     - Returns: All constraints created and activated for filling the view's superview.
